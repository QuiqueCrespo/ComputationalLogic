# Existential quantifier 

## Grammar

### Transitive predicates

We first have to define the syntactic and grammatical structure of the sentences. For this part we have defined sentences with transitive, intransitive and nominal predicates. The program handles sentences in this way:

- Nominal predicates:
  - Singular: Toby is a dog => dog(toby):-true.
  - Plural: Dogs are big => big(A):-dog(A).
- Transitive predicate:
  - Singular: Alice owns Toby => own(alice,toby):-true
  - Plural: Geniuses win prizes => win(prize,A) :- genius(A).
- Intransitive predicate: - Singular: Alice flys => fly(alice):-true. - Plural: birds fly => fly(A):-bird(A)
  By incorporating the ability to distinguish between general and particular statements the prolexa can learn and apply general rules.

```
> % Grammar
> sentence(Q) --> subject(s,S), predicate(s, S=>P), {Q=[(P:-true)]}.
> sentence(Q) --> subject(p,X=>S), predicate(p,X=>P), {Q=[(P:-S)]}.
> sentence(Q) --> subject(s,S), transitive_verb(s,S=>C=>P), direct_object(_,_=>C), {Q=[(P:-true)]}.
> sentence(Q) --> subject(p,X=>S), transitive_verb(p,X=>C=>P), direct_object(_,_=>C), {Q=[(P:-S)]}.
```

### Existential quantification

We must introduce the ability to interpret the existential determiner some. We simply add the following:
```
> sentence(Q) --> determiner(N,S,P,Q), subject(N,S), predicate(N,P).
> sentence(Q) --> determiner(N,S,P,C,Q), subject(N,S),transitive_verb(N,P), direct_object(_,_=>C).
```
And the definitions of those determiners, along with the logic to interpret them. Here we also must introduce the distinction between transitive and intransitive predicates in order to include the direct object meaning into the logical interpretation of the sentence.

```
% Determiners intransitive and nominal
determiner(p, ex=>H1, ex=>H2, [(H1:-true),(H2 :- true)]) --> [some].
% Determiners transitive
determiner(p, ex=>H1, ex=>C=>H2,C, [(H1:-true),(H2 :- true)]) --> [some].

```
In this case Prolog interprets this sentences as: 
- Some humans are geniuses => (human(ex):-true, genius(ex):-true)
- Some humans win prizes => (human(ex):-true, win(prize,ex):-true)

The reason for such a definition for the _some_ determinant is to introduce into the knowledge base at least one example of an atom that has both properties, in our case we call this atom _ex_.
To finalise the syntactical definitions we need to define the structure of the questions to allow us to query the knowledge base. Following the same logic we defined the following questions:

```
% questions
question((Q1,Q2)) --> [are,some],noun(p,X=>Q1),property(p,X=>Q2).
question((Q1,Q2)) --> [do,some],noun(p,X=>Q1),intransitive_verb(p,X=>Q2).
question((Q1,Q2)) --> [do,some],noun(p,X=>Q1),transitive_verb(p,X=>C=>Q2), direct_object(_,_=>C).
```

## Meta-interpreter

We have enabled Prolexa to interpret existential quantifiers, now we have to write the logic to enable it to answer queries about them. Given the following knowledge base:

```
peter is human.
peter is genius.
geniuses win prizes.
birds fly.
some animals are birds.
```
The program should be able to answer the queries:
```
"do some humans win prizes".
"do some animals fly".
```
Additionally, when an explanation is required for this need to be answers:
```
"peter is human; peter is genius; therefore some humans are genius"
"some animals are birds; birds fly; therefore some animals fly"
```
In order to archive this we have to edit the meta-interpreter:
```
prove_rb((A,B),Rulebase,P0,P):-
prove_rb(B,Rulebase,P0,P1),
prove_rb(A,Rulebase,P1,P),!.

prove_rb((A,B),Rulebase,P0,P):-
find_clause((A,B),Rule,Rulebase),
prove_rb(true,_,[p((A,B),Rule)|P0],P),!.

prove_rb((A,B),Rulebase,P0,P):-
find_clause((A,C),Rule,Rulebase),
prove_rb((C,B),Rulebase,[p((A,B),Rule)|P0],P),!.

prove_rb((A,B),Rulebase,P0,P):-
find_clause((B:-C),Rule,Rulebase),
prove_rb((A,C),Rulebase,[p((A,B),Rule)|P0],P),!.

prove_rb([(A:-B)],Rulebase,P0,P):-
find_clause((A:-B),Rule,Rulebase),
prove_rb(true,_,[p((A:-B),Rule)|P0],P),!.

prove_rb(A,Rulebase,P0,P):-
find_clause((A:-B),Rule,Rulebase),
prove_rb(B,Rulebase,[p((A),Rule)|P0],P),!.
```

### Limitations

While this programs has passed all our test we believe the meta-interpreter can be written in a more elegant and robust way, unifying both cases.


# Negation

To implement negation changes had to made to the following files: 1-prolexa.pl 2-prolexa_engine.pl 3-prolexa grammar. This section will detail and explain the changes required and document the testing done to evaluate the performance of the implementation. The negation was developed and tested in the context of happiness and teaching. In summary, we succeeded at enabling prolexa handle negation.

## Prolexa.pl - Rules
The changes to prolexa.pl included the changes in the rules which are defined below
```
stored_rule(1, [(teacher(X):-happy(X))]).
stored_rule(1,[(happy(peter):-true)]).
stored_rule(1, [(not(teacher(donald)):-true)]).
```
The first rules are based on prolog's syntax A:-B translating into if B is true then A is true. Therefore, the first rule implies that if you are happy then you are a teacher, the second rule implies that peter is happy and the third rule implies that donald is not a teacher. 

## prolexa_grammar.pl - Grammar

The change in grammar was required to add the following features to prolexa: 1- understand negation in the question e.g. "explain why donald is not happy". 2-understand donald when being referred to in the sentence 3-respond with coherent sentences to the new required explaination. The changes can be found below:

```
pred(happy,  1,[a/happy]).
pred(teacher,  1,[n/teacher]).
```
The above defines happy as an adjective and teacher as a noun, both required for the handling of the new example. 

```
proper_noun(s, donald) --> [donald]
```
The above define donald as a singular proper noun enabling prolexa to refer to him appropriately with the correct grammar, e.g. using is, where needed

```
sentence(Q) --> [everyone], adjective(s,X=>S), predicate(s,X=>P), {Q=[(P:-S)]}.
```
The above change is required such that use "everyone" in its determiner i.e. prolexa can respond with, for example, "everyone happy is a teacher, therefore, ....".


```
nominal_predicate(N,not(M)) --> nominal_verb(N),[not],property(s,M).
```
The above is a modification of the definition of the nominal_predicate provided in the already developed prolexa code. The only different is that it allow a negation to be present following a nominal verb and before a property e.g. it can handle "is not happy" compared to the default only able to handle "is happy". 

```
sentence(Q) --> subject(N,X),predicate(N,not(X=>L)), {Q=[(not(L):-true)]}.
question(Q) --> [is], subject(s, X),[not], property(s, X=>P), {Q=not(P)}.
question(Q) --> [are], subject(p, X=>S),[not], property(p, X=>P), {Q=[(not(P):-S)]}.
question(Q) --> [who], nominal_verb(N),[not], property(N, _=>P), {Q=not(P)}.
```
The above four definitions allow prolexa to handle questions with "not" in it. 

## prolexa_engine.pl - rule base proving

```
prove_rb(not B,Rulebase,P0,P):- % Added for negation
	write_debug(B),nl,
    find_clause((A:-B),Rule,Rulebase),
	write_debug(A),nl,
    prove_rb(not A,Rulebase,[p(not B,Rule)|P0],P).
```

The above searches the rule based such that not B implies A such that prolexa can navigate the defined rules and predicates that matches A:-Â¬B i.e. if not B then A. The process is done recursively until all the conditions are satisfied and prove is derived or until all options are explored. The write_debug is not required and was only used by us for testing and debugging. 


## Testing

The testing will document the outputs as they are from the interactive prolexa terminal.

*** answer(donald is not a teacher; everyone happy is a teacher; therefore donald is not happy)
donald is not a teacher; everyone happy is a teacher; therefore donald is not happy
```

The above testing shows that prolexa can now handle the rule teacher(X):-happy(X) as well as explain the negation of this rule.
